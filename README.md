# Nano-RTOS
A minimal preemptive RTOS built from scratch for the STM32F446RE. Features include context switching in ARM Cortex-M4 assembly, round-robin scheduling, blocking semaphores, mailbox IPC, FIFO queue, and per-thread stacks. Created as a learning journey from zero RTOS knowledge to understanding how real embedded kernels work internally.
